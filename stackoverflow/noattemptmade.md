{::comment}Trying a different tone in this one, referring to the OP as "we" instead of "you"{:/}
## It appears no attempt was made {#introduction}
We all have jobs to do. It may be homework, or for assigned work at our job. No matter what, it's our responsibility to get it done. Even when it seems like our task is too hard or we don't know where to start, it is always worth the effort to at least try.

There's work to be done. Whether it be homework or an assigned task at work, the person to whom it was assigned is expected to complete it. Even if it seems the task is too hard or there isn't a clear starting point, it's expected that an effort be made.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
StackOverflow is not a place to pass off one's assigned work. Asking other people to do work which it isn't their responsibility to complete borders on the rude and unethical. Putting forth the effort to attempt solving a problem, even if the attempt is not successful, results in new knowledge and experience that can't be had by simply passing the task off to someone else. Share the details of that attempt, even if unsuccessful, and those seeking to help are able to get to a solution more quickly without duplicating effort. If there isn't a clear starting point to even attempt a solution, this indicates that [more research is required before the question should be asked](/noresearch).

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
People find it rude to be asked to complete work which it isn't their responsibility to perform. If a question fails to demonstrate that effort was put forth to find a solution before being asked, it's likely to be viewed as lazy and may be down-voted or closed. Questions lacking effort tend to be misleading since it takes work to identify where the problem is. Misleading questions lead to unhelpful answers which fail to address the core issue. Such answers waste the time of both those asking for help and those seeking to provide it.

At a minimum, [questions should be researched before being asked](/noresearch). Including this research in the question makes it easier for the question to be answered. Describing what was found and why it didn't solve the problem helps to prevent others from suggesting these same solutions, increasing the chance that a satisfactory solution is provided.

If effort has been made but is not detailed in the question, those who try to answer it are likely to duplicate effort, wasting their time and making it less likely that a proper answer is given.

In some cases, simply asking the question may be a waste of the asker's time. Many times the research and effort required to properly prepare a question results in the asker finding the solution with less effort than would have been required to get the answer by asking a poorly-ressearched question. A simple search, [a little debugging](/nodebugging), and it would have been solved. And if asking the question would have wasted the asker's time, it certainly would have wasted the time of anyone who tried to answer.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
{::comment}In this section, cover how the problem can be fixed.{:/}
If an effort was made, edit the question to detail exactly what was tried. Adding "I googled and found nothing" is not helpful. Instead, list search terms used and include links to anything that seemed helpful but did not solve the problem. If a code solution was attempted, edit the question to include it. Attempts should be turned into a [minimal, complete, verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) to make it easy to understand.

If no effort was made before asking the question and noone has yet attempted to answer the question, delete the question immediately. Save the link to the question before deleting it. Then go back and put in the effort to attempt to find a solution. Do some research, documenting what research was done, what was found, and, if it didn't solve the problem, why. Create a small prototype that isolates the issue. Make at least one attempt at implementing a solution. If the solution still proves illusive after taking these steps, return to the deleted question using the saved link. Edit it and add the details of the research done and solutions attempted. Then undelete the question. It now has enough information for people to attempt an answer.
